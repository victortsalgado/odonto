  "faq.1.question": "How long does it take to implement all automations?",
  "faq.1.answer": "Complete implementation takes between 2-4 weeks, depending on your clinic's complexity and existing systems. We start with the highest impact modules: scheduling and reminders. Each additional module is implemented gradually to ensure team adaptation.",
  
  "faq.2.question": "Do I need to change my current management system?",
  "faq.2.answer": "No, our automations work with practically any dental management system on the market. We use native or API integrations, and in specific cases, we develop custom connectors. The idea is to enhance the systems you already use, not replace them.",
  
  "faq.3.question": "How does implementation work?",
  "faq.3.answer": "The process begins with a detailed analysis of your current workflow, followed by configuration of automations in Make and integration with your WhatsApp Business, systems and tools. We provide training for your team and a period of close follow-up for adjustments. Our implementation consultants ensure everything works perfectly.",
  
  "faq.4.question": "What results can I expect and in what timeframe?",
  "faq.4.answer": "On average, our partner clinics observe a 60% reduction in no-shows in the first month, a 30% increase in patient return rate within 3 months, and 15-20% savings in operational costs. The average ROI is 3-5 times the investment over a 6-month period, with a significant increase in patient satisfaction.",
  
  "faq.5.question": "Do I need technical knowledge to use it?",
  "faq.5.answer": "Absolutely not. Our team configures everything for you, and the management interface is extremely intuitive. We provide complete training for your team and ongoing support. Even system updates and maintenance are handled by us, so you can focus on patient care.",
